        Connect Four is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs
        from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically-suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next
        available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one\'s own discs of the same color next
        to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. (Source: Wikipedia)
